# get-dogged

A harmless, Bash-based script that displays fake errors. (and maybe has some refrences in)

**NOTE**: Before downloading the ZIP file, please verify the SHA256.


## Features
- **Non-destructive**: Only shows fake errors. No real system changes are made to your computer.
- **Customizable**: Change the script to your liking (Error messages and music).
- **ZIP download**: Pre-packaged releases with ease of use.
- **Lightweight**: Uses zenity (GUI) and mpv, mplayer, ffplay or vlc. (audio)

## Installation Process
1. Download the latest release (or any version):
```bash
https://github.com/kursataliakdag/get-dogged/releases
```
2. Unzip the archive
```bash
From now on, all scripts after dogged-3 will require to be on their folders (e.g ~/Downloads/dogged3).
First use "chmod +x dogged.sh" to make the script executable, then "./dogged.sh to run it.
```

## Dependencies
- `zenity`for the dialog
- `mpv`, `mplayer`, `ffplay` OR `vlc` (recommended).

Install on Debian/Ubuntu (or any Debian/Ubuntu based distro) if dependencies are missing:
```bash
sudo apt install zenity
```
```bash
sudo apt install vlc
```

## Okay, enjoy this thing I made!
