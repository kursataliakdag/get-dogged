# get-dogged
**This is just a stupid project with the dog.**
NOTE: This script is Linux-only. You can use a VM too but won't be too pleasent.
You must have mpv, mplayer, ffplay or vlc in order for it to work, with also zenity and wmctrl. If these are missing, use sudo apt install zenity and sudo apt install wmctrl.
PUT THE MP3 FILE ON THE DESKTOP, ANY OTHER PLACE WILL NOT WORK.
